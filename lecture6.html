<body>
    <div>It is also called read-write memory or the main memory or the primary memory.

        The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory.
        
        It is a volatile memory as the data is lost when the power is turned off.
        
        RAM is further classified into two types- SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).
